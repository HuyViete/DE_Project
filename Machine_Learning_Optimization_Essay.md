## 1. Introduction

Wine quality prediction represents a classic regression problem in machine learning, where multiple physicochemical properties are used to predict wine quality ratings. This project demonstrates a methodical approach to machine learning model development, starting from basic implementations and progressively incorporating advanced optimization techniques. The work encompasses three main phases: initial model comparison, advanced optimization techniques, and ultimate Bayesian optimization.

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing

The project utilized the Wine Quality dataset (winequalityN.csv), containing 6,497 wine samples with 13 features including physicochemical properties such as acidity levels, sugar content, alcohol percentage, and quality ratings. The initial data exploration revealed:

- **Missing Data**: 38 missing values (0.04% of total data)
- **Target Variable**: Wine quality ratings ranging from 3 to 9
- **Feature Types**: 11 numerical features and 1 categorical feature (wine type)

The preprocessing pipeline implemented several best practices:
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features
- **Label Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder
- **Standardization**: StandardScaler was applied to normalize feature distributions
- **Data Integrity**: Pipeline architecture ensured consistent preprocessing across training and testing phases
